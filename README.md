Introduction

The shift towards electric vehicles has been gaining momentum worldwide due to environmental concerns and advancements in battery technology. This project focuses on analyzing the EV population data in a specific region to provide valuable insights into the growth, trends, and characteristics of the electric vehicle market.

Installation

To use this project, you will need the following:

A compatible database management system (DBMS) such as MySQL, PostgreSQL, or SQL Server.
Access to a database containing the EV population data.
To set up the project, follow these steps:

Clone the repository using the following command:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/Amna-Khan-S/Electric_Vehicle.git
Set up the required database management system (DBMS) on your local machine or connect to an existing database server.

Import the "EV_POPULATION.sql" script into your database to create the necessary tables and views for analysis.

Update the database connection details in the script to ensure proper connectivity with your database.

Usage
To use this project, follow these steps:

Ensure that you have successfully completed the installation steps mentioned above.

Open the "EV_POPULATION.sql" script using a text editor or an SQL editor of your choice.

Review the script to understand the different SQL queries and views available for analysis.

Modify the SQL queries and views as per your specific requirements and research objectives.

Execute the SQL queries in your chosen SQL editor to perform the analysis on the EV population data.

Analyze the query results to gain insights into the growth, trends, and characteristics of the electric vehicle market in the specified region.

Data
The data used in this project is the EV population data specific to a particular region. The dataset contains information about various attributes of electric vehicles, such as vehicle make, model, year, registration date, battery capacity, charging infrastructure, and more. The dataset should be available in your database, and the "EV_POPULATION.sql" script assumes that the required tables and data are already present.

If you do not have the EV population data, you can substitute it with your own dataset by modifying the script accordingly. Ensure that the new dataset follows a similar structure and schema as the original dataset for the queries and views to work correctly.

Analysis
The "EV_POPULATION.sql" script provides several SQL queries and views to facilitate the analysis of the EV population data. Some of the analysis tasks that can be performed include:

Calculating the total number of electric vehicles registered over a specific period.
Identifying the top electric vehicle models by their registration count.
Analyzing the growth rate of the EV market over time.
Investigating the distribution of electric vehicles by make, model, and year.
Assessing the availability and usage of charging infrastructure for electric vehicles.
Feel free to explore the script and modify the queries as per your research objectives to obtain more specific insights into the EV population.
